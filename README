   * What is it?

This is a software package for testing of new Trigger Motherboard (TMB) that is being developed at Texas A&M University.
The TMB electronic board is a part of the Muond Endcap detector upgrade project at CMS experiment at CERN's Large Hardron Collider.

The TAMU TMB testing suite provides utilities for working on board prototypes, as well as a framework for production testing for ~100 of new bards.


   * Dependencies:

XDAQ   : http://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cmsos
EMULIB : https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/emu 

In EMULIB, the following packages are necessary:
emu/base
emu/soap
emu/emuDCS/PeripheralCore
emu/emuDCS/PeripheralApps
emu/emuDCS/OnlineDB

The EMULIB has to be installed into its usual development location $HOME/TriDAS/emu


The package is normally expected to live in the emu/emuDCS/TAMUTestStand location.
However, it could be checked out into anywhere, but the application has to be launched from the TAMUTestStand/ location.

   * Checking out:

git clone git://github.com/khotilov/TAMUTestStand.git
